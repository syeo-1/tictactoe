game of tic-tac-toe that looks presentable on both desktop and mobile. implemented minimax algorithm for user to play against

Things I learned about:
- using the module pattern and factory method to aid with code organization
- manipulating classlists to add styles to html elements based on events like button presses in vanilla JS
- set onsubmit for html forms to return false to keep data without refreshing the page

Things to improve for future projects:
- although factory methods and module pattern were technically used, all variables and functions used were public
    - defeats the purpose of learning these design methodologies. try to contain more functions/variables within modules and factories in the future
- continue utilizing emmet, but not just for html, try using it for css as well 

Things improved from previous project (library):
- growing more familiar with using emmet, but only for html so far
